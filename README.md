# LangChain Prompts

LangChain prompt templates enable developers to create dynamic, flexible instructions for large language models (LLMs). By using templates with placeholders, prompts can be customized with user input or contextual data before being sent to the model. This allows for precise control over model behavior and output style.

## What is a Prompt Template?

A prompt template is a structured text format that includes variables (placeholders) to be filled dynamically. LangChain supports different types of prompt templates, including simple string templates and more complex chat-based message templates.

These templates transform raw user input and application data into formatted prompts that guide the language model in generating relevant and coherent responses.

## Prompt Template Types in LangChain

- **String PromptTemplate**: Formats a single string with placeholders. Useful for simple prompts like "Tell me a joke about {topic}."

- **ChatPromptTemplate**: Manages multiple chat messages as a list, including different roles such as `system`, `human`, and `ai`. This allows for more interactive and context-rich conversations.

## Example: Using ChatPromptTemplate


This code creates a chat prompt where the system message sets the assistant's role, and the human message asks a question. The placeholders `{domain}` and `{topic}` are replaced dynamically when invoking the prompt.

## Benefits of Using Prompts in LangChain

- **Dynamic Content**: Easily inject user data, context, or variables into the prompt.
- **Improved Model Guidance**: Explicit instructions help guide the LLM to produce more accurate and useful outputs.
- **Modularity**: Prompts can be composed, reused, and nested for complex workflows.
- **Few-Shot Learning**: You can include examples within prompts to improve model understanding for specific tasks.

## Prompt Engineering Tips

- Keep prompts clear and concise to avoid confusing the model.
- Use system messages to define the assistantâ€™s behavior and role.
- Include few-shot examples to provide context or demonstrate expected output.
- Experiment with chunk size and overlap when working with long documents for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) setups.

## Advanced Features

- **Partial Formatting**: Fill in some placeholders early and others later, enabling prompt reuse with changing data.
- **Structured Output**: Define output schemas to extract structured data from the model response.
- **Template Formats**: Supports `f-string` and `mustache` style templates for flexible variable integration.
